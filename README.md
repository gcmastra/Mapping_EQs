Example 1: Daytime mode, street view, tectonic plate lines selected, Earthquakes selected on top of Major Earthquakes

Note in the image above, the color palette for Major Earthquakes is slightly different than All Earthquakes 
to be able to tell them apart when both are selected.

All layers can be selected or unselected using the Layer selector in upper right corner. 

  
Example 3:  Satellite mode, all map layers selected. <br>

Note in the image above, if you look closely at the URL in the browser, the map was working on GitHub pages, 
but I removed the config.js after testing.
